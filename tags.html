        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> I am a senior at the University of Washington majoring in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Indonesia.<br/>
            I have a few hobbies, including playing badminton, streaming music and shows, travelling to new places, and eating <br/>
            new food. My interest, aside from computing stuff, is politics and philosophy
        </p>
        <p>
            I am really excited but excited nervous about what the future lies ahead. I hope that I can work for a good company <br/>
            or even make a startup that I can be proud of. 
        </p>
